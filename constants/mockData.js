The upper features a zippered shroud in black textile, contrasted by white molded foam paneling with debossed three-stripes at the midfoot. A reinforced rubber toe cap gives a nod to The Kobe 2, along with adidas’ shell-toe heritage. Underfoot, the herringbone-traction rubber outsole reveals an exposed TPU shank for midfoot stability."
